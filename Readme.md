# Sequence Classification with BERT using PyTorch

This code demonstrates how to perform sequence classification using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in PyTorch. It can be run in a Google Colab environment.

## Overview

BERT is a powerful pre-trained model for natural language understanding tasks, but this code adapts it to classify sequences of numerical data. The sequences are treated as text-like tokens, tokenized, and then used for classification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- PyTorch
- Transformers library (`transformers`)
- Google Colab (recommended)

## Usage

1. Prepare your sequence data and labels. Now it uses fake data!
